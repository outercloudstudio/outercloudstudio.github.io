---

This is a brief overview of MIT Battlecode 2026's game. This year's theme was "Uneasy Alliances".

## Game Overview
This year had two win conditions. Either kill all of the enemy's kings or have more points by the time the game ends.

The primary resource to manage was **cheese**. Many actions including spawning new units costed cheese. Other actions such as attacking could optionally consume cheese to be more effective.

## Units
This year, there were only three unit types.

### Baby Rats

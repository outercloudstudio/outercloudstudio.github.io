title: "Battlecode 2026 - The Game"
---

This is a brief overview of MIT Battlecode 2026's game. This year's theme was "Uneasy Alliances".

## Game Overview
This year had two win conditions. Either kill all of the enemy's kings or have more points by the time the game ends.

The primary resource to manage was **cheese**. Many actions including spawning new units costed cheese. Other actions such as attacking could optionally consume cheese to be more effective.

## Units
### Rat King

Rat kings act as your main control center. You start the game with one, although it is possible to form new ones later on. If all of your rat kings die, you lose the game. The Rat King is the only way to produce more baby rats. Each rat kings consumes 2 cheese per turn. You could form a new rat king by spending some cheese and combining 7 baby rats contained within a 3x3 square.


### Baby Rats

Baby rats act as your workers and soldiers. Their view range is limited to only in front. Baby rats primarly carry cheese back to the king or attack enemy rats. They have significantly less health than the king, but can move much faster. New Baby Rats cost a base 10 cheese with an increasing cost for every currently alive baby rat. This means producing baby rats is more expensive the more baby rats you currently have.

### Cat

Cats were a unique introduction to this year's game. Cats are neutral units controlled by neither player. Cats would attack rats and rat kings, so it was important to develop strategies to combat cats. Dealing damage to cats could award a significant amount of points, however cats could often kill a baby rat in a single hit and also have a very large amount of health. Cats provided a significant source of variablilty in games and received many behaviour fixes and balance patches throughout the competion making dealing with them particularly difficult.

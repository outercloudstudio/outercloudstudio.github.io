## Introduction

After discovering Battlecode just after getting admitted to MIT, I was extremely excited to finally get to compete. These type of programming competitions are some of my favorite activies to partake in. This year I put together our team, 3MiceWalkIntoABar consisting entirely of freshmen with zero Battlecode experience. Here's how we did it and how we almost drove our bot into the ground for tournament Sprint 2.

If you didn't particpate this year or want an explanation on this year's game, you should read this [brief introduction](./the-game.md).

Our team had four members.
1. Armaan Gomes - MIT
2. Liam Hanrahan (Me) - MIT
3. Paul Fang Li - WPI
4. Richard Xun - Georgia Tech

I'm super proud of what we managed to accomplish this year, and it was really fun to have all of us in person for the finals. I lead the bot development. Armaan and Richard did additional programming. Paul doesn't program so he helped strategize, review games, and create maps for use to test on.

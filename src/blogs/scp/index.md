## The List
Here's just a quick list of all my SCP writings so far.

### [SCP-9086](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9086)
An old decripit super computer is found abandoned. A program has been running on the device for years. How does that program feel?

-----

### [SCP-8168](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8168)
A researcher discovers lost work from a colleague no one remembers. It's too late. The memetic effects have already kicked in.

## My Head Canon
One of my goals is to maintain a consistent canon across stories. So far both SCPs have been written to "take place" at Site-111. I don't want to reveal too much about Site-111 since I really like the idea that you learn about the worldbuilding by picking up on little details in the stories. What I will say about Site-111 is that I plan for it to be a smaller, academic, and research centered site, inspired by what I see at MIT.

I also want to point out a few critisicms / suggestions that I hope to follow in future works:

### The Foundation is Large, but It isn't Unending
In my opinion, some articles portray the Foundation as almost large enough to maintain hundreds of sites and have millions upon millions of employees. I'd like to instead characterize the SCP Foundation as a large organization, but in resources, not so much in size. I can only imagine the Foundation having upwards of 150 sites, that is including all the sites around the globe, and counting small research / specialized sites in this count. I think that there should only be around 5 large sites, such as Site-17 and 19. 

### Memetics are Cool but Overused
The idea of infohazards, cognitohazards, memetics, and amnestics are all extremely interesting ideas. I've just simply read too many SCPs that deal with them recently. I'd like to see these ideas explored in different ways if they are used at all.

### The Foundation is Very Competent
The Foundation is staffed by the brightest and bravest minds humanity has produced. It needs to be extremely competent. That means when something goes wrong, it's not because someone was stupidly negligent. That isn't to say Foundation personel can't make mistakes, I just do not enjoy the articles where a clearly better decision making process could have been made. I'd say one of the prime examples where this is poorly executed is with MTF squads. Essentially the Foundation is aware the antimemetic and reality bending anomalies exist. Event basic personell and MTF agents should at least have some contingency or preperation to deal with these sort of events should they occur.

### Always be Wary of Powerscalling
The Foundation can contain extremely powerful beings. But these beings are rare and it takes a lot of resources and creativity to contain these beings. I'd like to see more less deadly / world ending threats that are instead explorations of different themes.

Okay. sorry about the rant. If you disagree with any of these, email me. I'm not the best writer yet, but hopefully as I write more, I can create some cool stories that employ these ideas effectively.

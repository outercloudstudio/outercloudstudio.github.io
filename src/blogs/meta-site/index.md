A quick meta blog on how I developed this site.

## Why?
First, a quick explanation for why I made this site. The inspiration was originally born out of the desire to publish a battlecode postmortem. Realizing I wouldn't have a good place to host a larger body of text, I set out to repurpose the *outercloud.dev* domain which I had owned for while but had remained mostly unused.

I've also begun to realize you're own little real estate on the web is a great idea. This website is not bound by any algorithm or 3rd party serving what I post. It's simply here for anyone to happen across. I hope more people might follow in this vein. I'd like to hear about yours if you make one!

## What Did I Use?
This website is constructed with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). Most of the content is written in markdown files, although I do add ocassional extra styling with some additonal HTML and CSS added to the markdown. The entire source of this website can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/outercloudstudio/outercloudstudio.github.io). Using a Github action, the website is built and deployed as a github page when I push changes to the repository. Almost everything is free. The only thing I actually pay for is the domain name. I actually own 4 that link directly to this site.
1. outercloud.dev
2. outercloud.org
3. outercloud.space
4. liamh.space

Perhaps I enjoy collecting domains too much.

The main font used on this site is [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono). The [Jgs](https://adelfaure.net/tools/jgs/) and [Newsreader](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader) fonts are also used in some special cases for emphasis.

## Inspiration and Design
I found inspiration from a number of sites I happened to stumble upon while researching. I knew from the beginning I would be going for a minimal, liteweight design somewhat inspired by old terminal nostalgia. [Louis-max's blog](https://louis-max.gitlab.io/blog/) was a huge inspiration and one of the initialy motivations to go ahead and make this blog. Also, if you're reading this Louis, thanks for using [Nudge](https://github.com/outercloudstudio/nudge). That was pretty cool :D 

I was also heavily inspired design wise by [Sebilune's site](https://sebilune.dev/). You might be able to pick out some elements I borrowed from them, such as the avatar in the corner and colorful underlined links.

Some other sites I looked at while developing this were <span class="no-wrap">https://functor.systems</span> and <span class="no-wrap">https://wongmjane.com.</span>

title: "Battlecode 2026 - The Game"
---

After discovering Battlecode just after getting admitted to MIT, I was extremely excited to finally get to compete. These type of programming competitions are some of my favorite activies to partake in. This year I put together our team, 3MiceWalkIntoABar consisting entirely of freshmen with zero Battlecode experience. Here's how we did it and how we almost drove our bot into the ground for tournament Sprint 2.

If you didn't participate this year or want a reminder about how this year's game worked, you should read [this brief introduction](./the-game.md).

## The List
Here's just a quick list of all my SCP writings so far.

### [SCP-9086](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9086)
An old decripit super computer is found abandoned. A program has been running on the device for years. How does that program feel?

-----

### [SCP-8168](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8168)
A researcher discovers lost work from a colleague no one remembers. It's too late. The memetic effects have already kicked in.

## My Head Canon
One of my goals is to maintain a consistent canon across stories. So far both SCPs have been written to "take place" at Site-111. I don't want to reveal too much about Site-111 since I really like the idea that you learn about the worldbuilding by picking up on little details in the stories. What I will say about Site-111 is that I plan for it to be a smaller, academic, and research centered site, inspired by what I see at MIT.

Memetics are cool but overused. The idea of information related anomalies is super interesting in my opinion, however I feel like I am seeing it too commonly in the articles I have been reading recently. In my head canon information related anomalies are one of the rarer more esoteric types.

The Foundation is large, but it isn't unending. I can only imagine the Foundation having upwards of 150 sites, that is including all the sites around the globe ranging from small special purpose sites. I think that there should only be a very limitted number of large sites, such as Site-17 and 19. It's a bit hard to describe the actual size that I'm imagining. Perhaps, it would not be incorrect to thing of it similar to if someone took the top universities around the world and combined them under a single organization.

The Foundation is very competent. The Foundation is staffed by the brightest and bravest minds humanity has produced. It needs to be extremely competent. That means when something goes wrong, it's not because someone was stupidly negligent. That isn't to say Foundation personel can't make mistakes. I'd say one of the prime examples where this is poorly executed is with MTF squads. Essentially the Foundation is aware of various types of anomolies, yet it often seems that MTF teams are not even remotely prepared even with last resort strategies on how to defend against anomalies that aren't basically agreesive creatures. Even basic personell and MTF agents should at least have some contingency or preperation to deal with these sort of events should they occur.

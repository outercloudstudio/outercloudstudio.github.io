## About Me
I'm looking for the <a href="https://youtu.be/CccHBlGrOu8?si=gf0rhzSqr50JL8QZ" target="_blank" class="newsreader">latent beauty of the world.</a> I like to think about systems and design experiencs. I'm either developing games or I'm writing open source software.

I try to always be positive, smile every day, and goof around. Maybe now you'll email me a joke? <span style="white-space: nowrap">(˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)</span>

I want to take a look at the systems we use everyday. How should we use the web? Which programming languages feel nice to use? Why is **every** operating system so trash? <span class="subtext">For you mega nerds out there: I daily drove Nixos, Arch, and Windows on each of my different devices. We seriously need to develop something better.</span>

I love the game Outer Wilds. Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite movie. The Way of Kings is the best book of all time, fight me. If you like any of these, **please** reach out I'd love to talk.
